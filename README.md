# About Lemon

- http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/

The Lemon program is an [LALR(1)]  [parser generator], written in C89 by [Richard Hipp] during the late 1980s.
It takes a context free grammar and converts it into a subroutine that will parse a file using that grammar.
Lemon is similar to the much more famous programs "YACC" and "BISON", but it's not compatible with them.
There are several important differences that distinguish Lemon from Yacc and Bison:

- Lemon uses a different context free grammar syntax, which is less prone to programming errors.
- The parser generated by Lemon is both re-entrant and thread-safe.
- In Yacc and Bison, the parser calls the tokenizer (aka _push parsing_ model).
    In Lemon, it's the tokenizer that calls the parser (aka _pull parsing_ model).
- Lemon includes the concept of a _non-terminal destructor_, which simplifies writing parsers that don't leak memory.
- Lemon doesn't use global variables.
    Yacc and Bison use global variables to pass information between the tokenizer and the parser.
- Lemon allows multiple parsers to be running simultaneously; Yacc and Bison do not.

Lemon's innovative design inspired Bison to embody some of these features in the course of time.
For a detailed history of Lemon, see the _[History of Lemon]_ section in [`lemon/lemon.md`][lemon.md].

The complete source code to the Lemon parser generator is contained in two files: [`lemon.c`][lemon.c] and [`lempar.c`][lempar.c].


# Project Contents

Currently, this repository contains only the official version of Lemon (public domain) taken from the [SQLite] project:

- [`/lemon/`](./lemon/) — original Lemon sources from [SQLite]:
    + [`/examples/`](./lemon/examples) — user-contributed examples.
    + [`/sliced/`][sliced/] — [de-amalgamated] Lemon (split sources).
    + [`lemon.c`][lemon.c] — parser generator program.
    + [`lempar.c`][lempar.c] — template for the parser generator.
    + [`lemon.md`][lemon.md] — documentation.

The `examples/` subfolder contains third-party examples based on this version of Lemon (the examples are not from the SQLite project).

There are many variations of the original Lemon code circulating over the Internet, and it's quite common to find tutorials and examples that rely on tweaked versions of Lemon, often in conjunction with other tools (like [re2c]).

To avoid confusion, in this project all examples are kept together with the Lemon version for which they were designed. Different versions of Lemon (forks, ports, etc.) will be kept in separate folders, and each version will have its own `examples/` subfolder.
The idea is to keep the Lemon Grove tidy and well structured, so that its users can easily distinguish which version of Lemon is where, and how to find examples for that specific version.

The [`sliced/` subfolder][sliced/] contains a [de-amalgamated] version of Lemon, i.e. the single `lemon.c` source file is split into separate modules (23 files), like it used to be originally.
Anyone interested in studying or porting the Lemon source code will find it easier to work on these individual modules, instead of the official single-file source (&gt;5600 lines).

Since de-amalgamation is done via a custom tool ([Lemon Slicer]) and derived from the code found in the `lemon/` folder, the Lemon sources in the `sliced/` folder will always mirror the code from the `lemon/` folder.
Whenever the latter is updated, the former gets updated too.

## Official Lemon

The official Lemon code, actively maintained as part of the [SQLite] project.

- [Lemon homepage]
- [Lemon documentation]
- Upstream Lemon sources on [SQLite] repository ([Fossil]):
    + [`lemon.c`](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/tool/lemon.c)

## Lemon Forks

Adaptations of Lemon that add new functionality or provide native integration with other tools.

### Lemonex

- https://github.com/renjipanicker/lemonex

Created by [@renjipanicker] in 2015, public domain.

Lemonex is an extension to the Lemon parser, developed to include a built-in lexer.

## Cross-Language Lemons

Lemon has been adapted to produce parser generators in other programming languages too, by tweaking its C source code and creating an _ad hoc_ version of `lempar.c` in the target language.

### Citron (Swift)

- https://github.com/roop/citron
- https://roopc.net/citron/

By [Roopesh Chander] in 2017, MIT licensed.

Citron is an LALR parser generator for Swift, based on the Lemon engine.

### Golemon (Go)

- https://github.com/nsf/golemon

Created by [@nsf] in 2010, public domain.

Outdate and no longer maintained, but a good starting point for anyone willing to revive the project.

### jlemon (Java)

- https://github.com/gwenn/jlemon

Created by [@gwenn] in 2017, released into the public domain via [Unlicense].

A fork of the LEMON parser generator that generates Java code and the associated SQL parser.

### Lemon.JS

- https://github.com/sormy/lemon-js

Created by [Artem Butusov] in 2017, public domain.

### Lemon PHP

- https://github.com/wez/lemon-php

Created by [Wez Furlong] in 2006, last updated in 2012, BSD-like license.

### Lemon Rust

- https://github.com/rodrigorc/lemon_rust

Created by [Rodrigo Rivas Costa] in 2015, released under Apache-2.0 license.

Lemon Rust is now deprecated in favour of [pomelo], by same author.


## Lemon Ports

Lemon implementations in other programming languages.

### lemon-mint (Rust)

- https://github.com/jeremiah-shaulov/lemon-mint
- https://lib.rs/crates/lemon-mint

By [Jeremiah Shaulov], released under MIT License.

Implementation of the Lemon parser generator as a Rust library with API.

### pomelo (Rust)

- https://github.com/rodrigorc/pomelo
- https://crates.io/crates/pomelo

By [Rodrigo Rivas Costa], released under dual license — MIT or Apache-2.0.

Implementation of the Lemon parser generator as a Rust procedural macro.

## Lemon Inspired

Lemon has played an influential role in the development of parser generators, serving as a model for the creation of similar tools. Here are links to some of them.

### limecc (Python)

- https://github.com/avakar/limecc

By [Martin Vejnár], Boost Software License 1.0.

limecc is a lexer and parser generator similar to other tools like Yacc, Bison and especially Lemon from which limecc sources inspiration. Grammars are written in a language called Lime, which describes lexical tokens, grammar productions, and sematic actions. The generator produces C++ code for the corresponding lexer and parser.

## Compiler Design in C

Free PDF book + sources, 984 pp.

- https://holub.com/compiler/

Originally published in 1990 by [Prentice-Hall Inc.], _Compiler Design in C_, by [Allen Holub], is an excellent book on the topic. Written in plain language, this book takes the reader through a 984 pages long journey on how to build a compiler, step by step, introducing and explaining each compiler component in detail, and providing source code examples of each implementation step.

Since the book is now out of print, the author has generously made it available for free download on his website, in PDF format, including all the source code files and the release notes.
